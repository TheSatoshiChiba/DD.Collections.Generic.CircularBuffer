# DD.Collections.Generic.CircularBuffer

This is a single-file implementation of a generic [Circular Buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) data structure for the .NET Standard 1.6.

The implementation itself is located within a single 'cs' [file](SharedCode/CircularBuffer.cs) for easy inclusion in your projects. The 'Visual Studio 2017' solution also includes a library [project](CircularBuffer/CircularBuffer.csproj) if you prefer assembly dependencies.

The implementation is tested via [NUnit](http://nunit.org). The tests can be found in the [CircularBuffer.Tests](CircularBuffer.Tests\CircularBuffer.Tests.csproj) project.
